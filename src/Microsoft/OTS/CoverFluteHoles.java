 *There is a flute with s holes of 1 unit each. Unfortunately n holes are imprefect and need to be covered with the help of an infintely long tape. The imprefect holes h are given in ascending order. There is a catch, you can only use a maximum of k cuts from the tape to cover the imperfect holes in the flute. While covering imperfect holes you can also cover perfect holes if need be.
